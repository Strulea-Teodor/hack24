# Kikinator - FAF Edition

## Overview
In this project, we address the lack of interactive tools celebrating the FAF community. This Quiz/Guesser-style game focuses on local personalities and fosters engagement among students and faculty. By asking context-specific questions, FAFGuessr narrows down possible figures in a fun, educational manner.

## Our Grand, Criteria-Driven Solution
